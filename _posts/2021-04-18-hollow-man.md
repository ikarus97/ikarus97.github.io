First heard the quotes from *Criminal Mind*.

> Between the idea\
> And the reality\
> Between the motion\
> And the act\
> Falls the Shadow


>Between the desire\
>And the spasm\
>Between the potency\
>And the existence\
>Between the essence\
>And the descent\
>Falls the Shadow
>


>This is the way the world ends\
>This is the way the world ends\
>This is the way the world ends\
>Not with a bang but a whimper.
