by Stephen King

Writing (...) is about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life, as well. It's about getting up, getting well, and getting over. Getting happy, okay? Getting happy.

Some of this book - perhaps too much - has been about how I learned to do it. Much of it has been about how you can do it better. The rest of it - and perhaps the best of it - is a permission slip: you can, you should, and if you're brave enough to start, *you will*. Writing is magic, as much the water of life as any other creative art. The water is free. So drink.

Drink and be filled up.
