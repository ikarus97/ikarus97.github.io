> Prof. X (young): So this is what becomes of us. Erik was right. Humanity does this to us.
> 
> Prof. X (old): Not if we show them a better path.

> Prof. X (young): You still believe?

> Prof. X (old): Just because someone stumbles, loses their way, doesn't mean they're lost forever. Sometimes, we all need a little help.


> Prof. X (old): It't not their pain you're afraid of. It's yours, Charles. And as frightening as it may be, that pain will make you stronger. If you allow yourself to feel it, embrace it. It will make you more powerful than you ever imagined. It's the greatest gift we have, to bear their pain without breaking. And it's born from the most human power. HOPE. Please, Charles. We need you to hope again.

> Hank: Power's back on.
> 
> Prof. X: Yes. Yes, it is.
