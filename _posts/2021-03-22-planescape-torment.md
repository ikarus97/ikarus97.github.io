> An elderly man was sitting alone on a dark path, right? He wasn’t certain of which direction to go, and 
> he’d forgotten both where he was travelling to and who he was. He’d sat down for a moment to rest his weary legs, 
> and suddenly looked up to see an elderly woman before him. She grinned toothlessly and with a cackle, spoke: "Now your *third* wish. What will it be?"
> 
> "Third wish?" The man was baffled. "How can it be a third wish if I haven’t had a first and second wish?"
> 
> "You’d had two wishes already," the hag said, "but your second wish was for me to return everything to the way it was before you had made your first wish. 
> That is why you remember nothing; because everything is the way it was before you made any wishes." She cackled at the poor berk. "So it is that you have one wish left."
> 
> "All right," said the man. "I don’t believe this; but there’s no harm in wishing. I wish to know who I am."
> 
> "Funny," said the old woman as she granted his wish and disappeared forever. "That was your first wish."
> 
> -- from Morte's story.

One of the best D&D games.
