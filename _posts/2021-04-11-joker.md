Dangerously beautiful and sad.

He had been trudging up the stairway in his struggle to stay on the surface.
Now that he'll never be coming back, he is merrily dancing down.
The way out is such a tempting and liberating thing.

Another beautiful and sad scene.
I believe that, at this point, he still was thinking of killing himself before Murray.
Imagine what it would feel like listening to the final insult before death... and he dances.

The movie reminded me of the line from *"Old Boy"* in a distorted way.
> "Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone."
> 
In his struggle, Arthur weeped (but looked laughing) alone. In madness, Joker laughs among the crowd.
