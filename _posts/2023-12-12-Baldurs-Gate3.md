**An Unsent Letter**

Dearest Tav,\
I don't know when you will read this, or if you will ever read this.\
But if you do, I will be one with the Weave now.


On our long and short journey,\
Parts of me always wished you rely on me during any difficult turn of events.\
As a capable magic wielder, as a trustworthy companion.\
But there were parts of me that didn’t want your eyes on me.\
Because that would mean that the time has come.\
The time to say good-bye.


Though I’ve already said good-bye many times over,\
To the sparks of fire at night, to the silver moon and bright stars,\
To the raindrops falling on the leaves, to the morning dew on the grass,\
To the wind rustling my hair, to the ray of sun warming my weary body.\
Each day is a bless, because I can enjoy them once more.\
Each day is a curse, because I have more to miss when I leave.


But I’m ready.\
I know the need is great; the stakes are high.\
Maybe this is what fate has set aside for me, from the moment I was born.\
The price of my gift.


The day is now over.\
Dawn will bring another bittersweet day for me.


Every time our eyes meet, each time your lips part,\
My feeble heart flutters; my weary soul flickers.\
Anticipating the joyful moment my friends will be free from troubles.\
Dreading the fearful moment I no longer share their joys.


But I’m ready.\
I’ll gladly lay me down when the time comes.\
I’ll happily answer when you call on me.


Dearest Tav,\
My blighted heart is yours to command.\
Only you can stop its beating.\
I’m ready.


-from a foolish wizard who set out to fix a broken heart.
