# 1. Preliminaries

* NumPy - container for data passed between algorithms and libraries.
* pandas - `DataFrame` and `Series`
* matplotlib - library for producing plots and 2D data visualizations.
* SciPy - collection of packages for problem domains in scientific computing.
* scikit-learn - machine-learning toolkit for python.
* Updating conda packages with pip might result in environment problems. Best update with conda first (when using Anaconda/Miniconda).

# 2. Python language basics, IPython, and Jupyter Notebooks
