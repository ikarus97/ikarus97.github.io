by Christina Rossetti

Remember me when I am gone away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone far away into the silent land;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you can no more hold me by the hand,<br>
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.<br>
Remember me when no more day by day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You tell me of our future that you plann'd:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only remember me; you understand<br>
It will be late to counsel then or pray.<br>
Yet if you should forget me for a while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And afterwards remember, do not grieve:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if the darkness and corruption leave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,<br>
Better by far you should forget and smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than that you should remember and be sad.
