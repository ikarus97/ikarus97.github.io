Liked the bittersweet characters and humors. Favorite season after "Murder House."

> Jimmy: You ever see those pictures in Life magazines of the African tribal warriors where the whole head and the skin of a lion like a cloak? That's what Ma Petite looked like. Except... (chuckles) ... except it was with a rabbit head.

> Elsa: (to drunken Jimmy and Dell) Idiots.
