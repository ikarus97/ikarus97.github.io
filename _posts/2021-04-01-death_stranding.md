A game that made me think about what is "*playing*".
I'd walked hours and hours in that barren-yet-beautiful world, listening just winds, rain, and my footsteps.
It was such a soothing and fulfilling experience. Few game can provide more satisfactory in-game travel experience.


Also features a villain with an impressive introduction:
> "The name's Higgs. The particle of God that permeates all existence."
