Strangely relatable movie. Not just about schizophrenia.

Every suffering is individual and personal, but mental suffering is even more so. It's almost impossible to communicate the pain, even to oneself.


It's sad to witness the inner pain and burden, with the only escape through death.
But the story turns to horror if the entire narrative is from "the voices."
