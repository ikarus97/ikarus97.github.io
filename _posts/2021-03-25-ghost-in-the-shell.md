> Puppet Master: "As a sentient life form, I hereby demand political asylum."
> 
> Chief Aramaki: "Is this a joke?"
> 
> Nakamura: "Ridiculous! It's programmed for self-preservation!"
> 
> Puppet Master: "It can also be argued that DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself. 
> Life has become more complex in the overwhelming sea of information. And life, when organized into species, relies upon genes to be its memory system. 
> So man is an individual only because of his intangible memory. But memory cannot be defined, yet it defines mankind. 
> The advent of computers and the subsequent accumulation of incalculable data has given rise to a new system of memory and thought, parallel to your own. 
> Humanity has underestimated the consequences of computerization."
> 
> Nakamura: "Nonsense! This babble is no proof at all that you're a living, thinking life form!"
> 
> Puppet Master: "How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?"
> 
> Chief Aramaki: "Who the hell is this?"
> 
> Nakamura: "Even if you do have a Ghost, we don't offer freedom to criminals! It's the wrong place and time to defect."
> 
> Puppet Master: "Time has been on my side, but by acquiring a body, I am now subject to the possibility of dying. Fortunately, there is no death sentence in this country."
> 
> Chief Aramaki: "What is it? Artificial intelligence...?"
> 
> Puppet Master: "Incorrect. I am not an AI. My code name is Project 2501. I am a living, thinking entity that was created in the sea of information."
