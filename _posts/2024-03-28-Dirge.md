# Dirge Without Mugic
by Edna St. Vincent Millay

I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.<br>
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:<br>
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned<br>
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.


Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.<br>
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.<br>
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,<br>
A formula, a phrase remains, &mdash;but the best is lost.


The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,&mdash;<br>
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled<br>
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.<br>
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.


Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave<br>
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;<br>
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.<br>
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.
